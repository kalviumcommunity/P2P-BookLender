# P2P Book Lender
DBMS Project by @nikiljos

### About
A peer-to-peer book lending platform where any user can list a book as available and another user can request the book from the owner.

The owner can approve/reject the request. Once approved, the user can collect the book from the owner and the status is updated to collected by the receiving person. 

Once the person returns the book, the owner updates the same and the status becomes available again, allowing others to further request the book.
